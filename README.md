🪞 Smart Mirror – Weather-Based Clothing & Fabric Recommendation System

A Smart Mirror application that recommends the best clothing fabric (cotton, polyester, nylon, wool, etc.) based on real-time weather conditions such as temperature and humidity.
The system uses Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression to predict the most comfortable fabric for the user.

🚀 Features

🌦 Live weather-based clothing suggestion

🧠 Machine Learning (Linear & Multiple Linear Regression)

📊 Data visualization using R (Boxplot, Histogram, Line Graph, Scatter Plot)

👕 Fabric recommendation based on comfort score

🪞 Smart mirror concept for daily outfit planning

📘 Clean documentation and easy-to-understand code

🧠 Machine Learning Used
Linear Regression

Used to predict user comfort from a single factor, such as temperature.

Multiple Linear Regression

Predicts comfort using multiple weather factors like temperature and humidity for more accurate predictions.

🧵 Fabric Recommendations (Examples)
Weather	Recommended Fabric
Hot & Humid	Cotton, Linen
Cool	Polyester
Cold	Wool
Rainy	Nylon, Waterproof
